## Unreleased

### Features

- Add `package:dartc/source.dart` for source snapshots, UTF-16 ranges, line and column lookup, and custom source providers.
- Add `package:dartc/diagnostics.dart` for structured diagnostics with severity, error codes, source ranges, and related notes.
- Add `package:dartc/scanner.dart` for source-preserving Dart tokens, nested string interpolation and comments, and recoverable lexical diagnostics.
- Add `package:dartc/ast.dart` for immutable syntax trees with checked source ranges and depth-first traversal. Includes compilation units, library directives, classes, mixins, enums, extensions, extension types, constructors, functions, variables, type aliases, expressions, patterns, and statements.
- Add `package:dartc/parser.dart` to parse expressions and type annotations from scanner results. Supports operators, generic calls and function values, explicit constructor calls, type tests and casts, super receivers, member and index access, cascades, contextual dot shorthands, Symbol and interpolated string literals, records with optional `const`, collection literals with spreads and control-flow elements, and named, function and record types. Return structured diagnostics and source-preserving recovery nodes for incomplete input.
- Add `parseStatement` for blocks, local variable declarations, branches, loops, labels, jumps, assertions and try/catch/finally. Parse `throw` expressions and retain written conditions, optional initializers and catch parameters.
- Add `parseFormalParameterList` for positional and named parameters, written defaults, metadata, receiver prefixes and nested function-form parameters with generic bounds.
- Add `parseFunctionBody` for block, arrow and empty declaration bodies, including asynchronous and generator modifiers. Parse `await`, `yield`, `yield*` and `await for` in their function context and report invalid modifier combinations.
- Parse anonymous functions and local function declarations with generic parameters, annotations, defaults and nested asynchronous or generator bodies.
- Add `parseCompilationUnit` for library directives, top-level declarations, classes, mixins, enums, extensions, extension types and their members. Preserve primary and abbreviated constructors, initializer lists, factory redirections and type metadata.

- Add `parsePattern` with matching, declaration and assignment contexts. Parse structural and logical patterns, guards, if-case, switch expressions and statements, destructuring assignments and pattern loop headers. Preserve metadata on local and loop declarations.

### Fixes

- Parse functions named with contextual keywords such as `import`, `external` and `mixin`, and generic methods named `factory`.
- Return syntax diagnostics for unfinished constructor assertions and switch labels without throwing or consuming subsequent declarations.

### Performance

- Reduce temporary allocations when scanning identifiers and speed up scanning of whitespace runs.
- Reduce parsing time and memory use for long chains of ambiguous null-aware index expressions, including subsequent member access, calls and indexes.
- Improve parser scaling for deeply nested collections, blocks and incomplete delimiters.
- Reduce speculative type parsing when distinguishing declarations from expressions.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/medz/dartc/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) — 2026-10-31

This release adds generic classes, automatic memory reclamation, native-library export declarations and Intel Mac support. Native compiler downloads now work as a single executable. Dart language and standard-library support remains incomplete; see the [versioned specification tracker](https://github.com/medz/dartc/tree/v0.5.0/specs) for supported behavior and gaps.

### Features

- Support generic class instances and const objects, constructor type inference, runtime type-argument checks and generic object patterns.
- Add class modifiers and sealed-class exhaustiveness checking, covariant instance parameters and fields, abstract instance fields, and field-type inference from initializers and interfaces.
- Improve generic call inference using declared bounds and callback context. Support user-defined relational operators in patterns and indexed assignments through `super`.
- Add core error and exception classes. Invalid integer/double parsing, integer division and modulo by zero, supported type checks, invalid character codes and unsupported list mutations now throw catchable Dart errors or exceptions. Preserve the first stack trace attached to an `Error`.
- Add Intel Mac (`macos-x64`) compiler and executable support alongside macOS ARM64 and Linux ARM64/x86-64.
- Export functions and scalar read-only data with `@Export<T>` for macOS and Linux object files, static libraries and shared libraries on ARM64/x86-64. Generate matching C/C++ headers, including mixed integer, double, boolean and pointer signatures.
- Embed required library sources in native compiler binaries, so the compiler can be moved without an accompanying `lib/` directory. Include `package:dartc/export.dart` for native-library projects.
- Report source diagnostics on stderr with file, line, column and source text, including errors in imports and parts. Help and successful build output use stdout.

### Fixes

- Reject output paths that would overwrite source files or package configuration, including symbolic links, hard links and case aliases. Create missing output directories in native builds.
- Preserve source BOMs and handle malformed UTF-8 consistently; reject invalid UTF-8 in package configuration and process arguments.
- Preserve double NaN identity, signs and payloads, including target-specific constants during cross-compilation.
- Fix macOS library export-name encoding and static-archive alignment for Darwin linkers.
- Distinguish bound-method runtime signatures during function type checks.

### Performance

- Reclaim unreachable managed objects, reuse freed storage and release empty allocation regions instead of retaining all allocations until process exit.
- Improve polymorphic calls, ARM64 double register use, common string operations and small pure calls.
- Reduce repeated package lookups, liveness analysis and compiler-buffer allocation during compilation.

### Upgrading from 0.4

- Replace the previous native installation with the 0.5.0 archive. Its `bin/dartc` can be copied anywhere on `PATH`; no adjacent `lib/` directory is required.
- Replace `--export` and `Pointer.fromFunction` export bindings with `@Export<T>` declarations from `package:dartc/export.dart`. Use `--header` to choose the generated header path.
- The SDK-hosted package and source development now require Dart SDK `^3.13.7`.
- The old bootstrap-validation, benchmark and fuzz commands are no longer distributed. Source development uses the standard Dart package tools.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/medz/dartc/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) — 2026-10-29

This release adds Linux x86-64 binaries and expands native Dart programs with class hierarchies, enums, custom operators, doubles and synchronous exceptions. It remains an early preview, with Dart SDK 3.13.7 as the behavior reference.

### Features

- **Platforms:** add Linux x86-64 executables and a native compiler archive alongside macOS ARM64 and Linux ARM64. All three targets can compile the compiler and generate executables for the other targets.
- **Classes:** support non-generic abstract classes, inheritance and interfaces, including inherited fields, implementation dispatch, `super` access and constructor chains.
- **Constructors:** add primary constructors, declaring parameters, `super` parameters, factories, const factories and factory redirection. Support constructor function values and contextual dot shorthands for supported constructors and static members.
- **Enums:** support simple and enhanced non-generic enums, with fields, constructors, methods, `values`, `index`, `name` and exhaustive switches.
- **Operators:** support user-defined binary and unary operators, `[]` and `[]=`, including subclass dispatch, compound assignment and increments. `operator ==` remains a language implementation gap.
- **Function values:** accept optional positional and named parameters, preserve target defaults and check structural function types. Non-generic closures inside generic functions can capture enclosing type arguments as well as values.
- **Numbers:** add native double literals, arithmetic, mixed numeric values, decimal parsing, shortest round-trip formatting, conversions and constants.
- **Exceptions:** support synchronous `throw`, `try`/`on`/`catch`/`finally` and `rethrow`, including cleanup during returns and jumps. Add `StackTrace.current`, `StackTrace.fromString` and `StackTrace.empty`.
- **Variables:** support lazy `late` locals, captured variables, top-level/static variables and typed instance fields, including final assignment and reentrant initialization checks.

### Fixes

- Integer division or modulo by zero on ARM64 now terminates before later side effects instead of producing a value. Runtime errors still cannot be caught as Dart exceptions.
- Indexed assignments preserve separate read/write index conversions, short-circuiting and evaluation order when user-defined operators participate.
- Non-returning calls remain non-returning in native code. Return inference and missing-return checks account for null-aware elements and empty `List<Never>` spreads.
- Setter and `[]=` return types accept aliases resolving to `void`; invalid return types are checked even in unused declarations. Constructor function signatures retain inferred field and super parameter types.

### Upgrading from 0.3

Replace the complete native archive, keeping its `bin/` and `lib/` directories together. The runtime ABI changes from 14 to 17; compiler, runtime, layout and standard-library files must come from the same release.

For a source build, use the 0.4.0 native compiler for your host as the bootstrap seed. A 0.3 compiler does not understand all the syntax now used by dartc itself:

```sh
dart tool/bootstrap.dart --seed /path/to/dartc-0.4.0-macos-arm64/bin/dartc
```

The SDK-hosted package can be updated with `dart pub global activate dartc 0.4.0`. Language implementation remains incomplete; detailed behavior and gaps are in [specs](https://github.com/medz/dartc/tree/v0.4.0/specs).

## 0.3.0

Early preview release for macOS and Linux ARM64, with Dart SDK 3.13.7 as the behavior reference.

- Add lexical captures to local and anonymous functions, including shared writes, `this`, recursion and per-iteration loop bindings.
- Support bound instance-method values, callable objects and implicit `call` extraction in supported function contexts.
- Support generic top-level and method calls with bounds, partial contextual inference and runtime type arguments, including type-changing recursion; add generic aliases and traditional function typedefs.
- Support switch expressions, if-case, object/List patterns, destructuring declarations and assignments, pattern loops and pattern switch statements with guards and shared case bodies.
- Support cascades, null-aware member/index chains and List conditional, loop, spread and null-aware elements.
- Add static members, named and const constructors, field initializer lists, generative redirection, explicit `new` and constructor aliases.
- Implement `List.insert`, `List.removeAt`, `List.sublist`, `StringBuffer.writeCharCode` and `StringBuffer.isNotEmpty`.
- Update the native runtime ABI from 11 to 14 for captured values, bound methods and heap type metadata. Use the compiler and runtime sources from the same release.
- Reject stale artifacts and incomplete validation evidence; bootstrap keeps the existing verified seed when rebuilding or validation fails.

Language implementation remains incomplete. Current behavior and remaining gaps are tracked in [specs/](specs/README.md).

## 0.2.0

Early preview release for macOS and Linux ARM64.

- Provide standalone native compiler archives with compatible runtime sources.
- Support simple classes, accessors, nullable/reified value checks, canonical const instances and lazy top-level initialization.
- Add noncapturing local and anonymous functions, structural function types and nongeneric type aliases.
- Resolve package configuration v2, language versions, file/package URIs, conditional imports and library parts.
- Include only the runtime components required by the program.

Captures, inheritance, general generics, exceptions, async code and most SDK libraries remain unsupported. Runtime sources and native compiler binaries from older releases must not be mixed with this version.

## 0.1.0

- Compile functions, control flow, strings, lists, and relative imports.
- Build a standalone native compiler that can compile its own Dart sources.
- Generate macOS and Linux ARM64 executables, including local Mach-O signatures in Dart.
- Export explicitly typed FFI callbacks as experimental macOS native libraries.

## 0.0.1

- Compile main and string-literal print calls to standalone macOS ARM64 executables.
